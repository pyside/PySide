QML Tutorial
************

This tutorial gives an introduction to QML, the mark up language for Qt Quick. It doesn't cover everything;
the emphasis is on teaching the key principles, and features are introduced as needed.

Through the different steps of this tutorial we will learn about QML basic types, we will create our own QML component
with properties and signals, and we will create a simple animation with the help of states and transitions.

Chapter one starts with a minimal "Hello world" program and the following chapters introduce new concepts.

The tutorial's source code can be downloaded :download:`here<helloworld.tar.bz2>`.
